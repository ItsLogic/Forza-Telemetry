# Forza-Telemetry
A UDP data stream reader for FH4


Currently in very early stages. Only has basic functionality of reading the FH4 data format and outputting into text boxes


# I plan to:

Create a new UI for this program. Possibly move to WPF

Change the way it grabs and displays data

Add an option for which port it should read data from

Add options to hide and show certain parts of the data for a more condensed and focused view

Add support For FM7 and a UI toggle to switch between games

# Issues:
If you have an issue with the app not getting any data output I would recommend taking a look at [this page](https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/SimHub-Basics----Games-config-and-troubleshooting#forza-horizon-4--motorsport-7 "SimHub Wiki") referenced in [this issue](../../issues/1)
