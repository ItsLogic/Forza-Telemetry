# Forza-Telemetry
A UDP data stream reader for FH4


Currently in very early stages. Only has basic functionality of reading the FH4 data format and outputting into text boxes


# I plan to:

Create a new UI for this program

Change the way it grabs/displays data

Add options for which IP and port combo it should read data from

Add options to hide and show certain parts of the data for a more condensed and focused view

Add support For FM7 using a UI toggle
